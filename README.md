# zero-to-ai

> From zero to leverage — a practical AI playbook by **Shean Zero**.

**zero-to-ai** is my personal repository of applied AI practices:  
**best practices**, **reusable skills** (prompts / patterns), **end-to-end workflows**, **templates**, and a **curated resource index** across LLMs, agents, automation, RAG, and multimodal use cases.

The intent: turn “I know how to use AI” into “I can use AI reliably, quickly, and repeatedly.”

---

## What you’ll find here

- **Best Practices**: principles, pitfalls, quality checks (accuracy / safety / cost / speed)
- **Skills**: reusable prompt patterns, decomposition strategies, agent design patterns
- **Workflows**: end-to-end processes from input → output → verification → iteration
- **Templates**: copy-paste formats for common deliverables (research, writing, product, engineering)
- **Resources**: curated tools / papers / courses / articles with short notes

## Quick start

1. Start with: `00-start-here/`
2. Pick what you need:
   - For reliability & quality: `01-best-practices/`
   - For reusable patterns: `02-skills/`
   - For shipping end-to-end: `03-workflows/`
   - For copy-paste deliverables: `04-templates/`
   - For references & tooling: `05-resources/`
3. Tag your notes for retrieval:
   - `#writing #research #coding #product #data #agent #automation`

## How I write a “reusable” note

Each note tries to answer:

- **When**: the scenario / trigger
- **Goal**: what success looks like (preferably measurable)
- **Inputs**: what you provide (context, data, constraints, examples)
- **Steps / Prompt**: the core approach or prompt
- **Outputs**: required structure / format
- **Checks**: how to verify (correctness, completeness, citations, safety)
- **Variations**: cheaper/faster/stronger variants
- **Pitfalls**: common failure modes

## Minimal note template (copy-paste)

```text
# Title: one line description

- When:
- Goal:
- Inputs:
- Outputs:
- Steps / Prompt:
- Checks:
- Variations:
- Pitfalls:

## Roadmap
	•	Prompt & agent patterns library
	•	Evaluation: rubrics, comparisons, automated checks
	•	Cost/latency optimization: model selection, caching, iteration loops
	•	RAG: retrieval strategy, indexing, grounding, citation discipline
	•	Multimodal workflows: image/audio/video + structured outputs
	•	Automation: scripts and repeatable pipelines

⸻

## Contributing

This is primarily a personal repo, but PRs are welcome for:
	•	fixes / clarifications
	•	stronger patterns or checklists
	•	high-quality resources (with short notes: who it’s for, pros/cons, cost)
